    <h1> Redemption Centers in New York are Closing While the Bottle Bill Gets Postponed </h1>

    <!-- SUBHEAD GOES HERE -->
    <p> Redemption centers are closing because of the economic difficulties they face since they have not received a raise for the work they do for 40 years. The new Bottle Bill would double the payment currently received by recyclers and redemption centers in New York State. </p>

    <!-- BODY OF THE STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE! -->

    <p> Redemption centers have been <a href="https://www.nypirg.org/pubs/202406/Release_Recycling_6.28.24.pdf"> closing massively </a> since 2022 because of economic struggles. </p> 

    <p> The new <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S237/amendment/C"> Bottle Bill </a> proposes to raise the deposit fee from 5 cents to 10, and the handling fee from 3.5 to 6 cents. This would double the current revenue of the state's independent redemption centers and recyclers. </p>

     <p> If it is approved, the distributors will have to invest more money in recycling the containers of the products they sell. But according to the <a href="https://www.bottlebill.org/index.php/bottle-bill-opponents"> Container Recycling Institute </a> the main opponents of the bill are companies like PepsiCo, Coca Cola and Anheuser Busch. </p>

     <p> In 2023 the bill was discussed in the New York State Assembly, but it did not pass. It will be discussed again in the next legislative session on January 28th, 2025. </p>

     <p> Jade Eddy, owner of MT Returnables redemption center located in Queensbury, NY, and member of the <a href="https://www.empirestateredemptionassociation.com/"> Empire State Redemption Association </a>, is thinking about closing her business because she doesn't have the money to stay afloat. </p>

    <p>  “I am currently receiving poverty assistance, I spent all my retirement savings and lost my house to try to keep my business afloat,” Eddy said with disappointment. “The position they have put us in is criminal because I see legislators in Albany more concerned about big companies like Pepsi, who oppose the Bottle Bill, than about the small businesses that serve their communities.” </p>

     <p> In the following map you can see the redemption centers that have closed recently in each New York county and the ones that are staying afloat. </p>
